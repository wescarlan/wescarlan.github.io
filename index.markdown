I'm a software engineer from Georgia Tech who specializes in native Android and iOS development. Originally from Atlanta, I've recently moved to San Francisco to pursue futher development in my career.

I have two cats, Catwrap Supreme and Skully, and a loving partner who I moved with.

On weekends you'll find me at home playing video games and working on a project, or you'll find me out exploring new facets of the city and indulging in craft tiki cocktails.

## My experience

<br/>

>I've been working at NCR for the past 5+ years building white label mobile apps for banks and restaurants. It was my first full-time job out of college, and I started as an entry level software engineer working in Atlanta. Since then I've gotten the opportunity to lead a team of developers, and more recently it's brought me to the Bay Area.

### NCR Corporation
#### __Senior Mobile Developer - Digital Banking__
##### _Redwood City, CA (Sep 2019 - Present)_
My current role is operating as a senior mobile engineer building white label apps for business and consumer banking. We have over 600 financial institutions who rely on the applications we build, and there is a heavy emphasis on security and flawless user experience. I'm implementing features for both iOS and Android platforms, and I'm even dipping my toes in server-side development when needed.

Transitioning to this team was a difficult decision for me to make, but it was a chance for me to have an impact on one of NCR's most profitable platforms.

#### __Lead Mobile Developer - Hospitality__
##### _Atlanta, GA (May 2015 - Sep 2019)_
I started my career at NCR working as an Android engineer in the Hospitality department. At the time, we had 2 major customers - KFC Australia and Krispy Kreme. I had previously made a couple of Android apps as class projects in college, but I learned a great deal about the Android app lifecycle and multithreading from working with the experienced developers on my team.

After a year of attrition in the department, I was asked to help out the iOS team since they were lacking dev-power. I had never worked with Objective-C or Swift at the time, but I was quick to pick it up and start contributing to new features. Most of what I learned of the iOS platform was self-taught since the team was so small, so I found myself making comparisons to the Android platform very early on. This is perhaps what contributed most to my desire to be a cross-platform developer.

After another two years of iOS development, I was able to persuade my manager into merging the iOS and Android teams so that our features were not so disparate. The other advantage to this was that developers, such as myself, now had the opportunity to work cross-platform. In doing such, I was able to make major contributions to the mobile product's continuous integration and continuous deployment. I wrote UI tests that eventually replaced manual QA efforts, and I created a developer tool for automating the onboarding process for new clients.

I was eventually promoted to the lead developer position for the mobile team, overseeing a group of 10+ developers. I lead all SCRUM ceremonies and acted as a mentor for junior engineers. My contributions to automation and the app's maintainability made it possible for us to have more than 40 restaurants using our mobile app by the time I left the team. I pride myself in being able to leave the team in a position that they could continue to grow after my departure.

### Turner Broadcasting
#### __Intern, Part-time Developer - CNN__
##### _Atlanta, GA (Jun 2014 - Mar 2015)_
During my third year of college, I was hired as a summer intern at CNN with the responsibility of creating automated tests for the CNNgo website. My manager saw the value in the automation I was writing, and hept me on the team part-time throughout my senior year of college.
